## Contributions

DogeHouse is open to contributions, but I recommend creating an issue or replying in a comment to let me know what you are working on first that way we don't overwrite each other.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse/blob/staging/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on this project.

## DogeHouse Desktop

A desktop app built with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

There are different ways to get the Electron desktop app:

* Get the official builds from [here, in GitHub Releases][gh-releases]
for any platform.
* Get it from AUR (unofficial package) for Arch/Manjaro or other Arch-based distro with
`yay -S dogehouse`, using another AUR helper, or installing manually from the AUR.
* Get the desktop client for Debian-based distros (including Ubuntu)
from the official APT repo with these simple steps:
  * Add the repo with `echo "deb http://ppa.dogehouse.tv/ ./" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list > /dev/null`
  * Add Ben Awad's GPG key with `$(command -v curl>>/dev/null && echo "curl -o-" || echo "wget -q0-") http://ppa.dogehouse.tv/KEY.gpg | sudo apt-key add -`.
  * Finally, update your local repository list and install DogeHouse
with `sudo apt update && sudo apt install dogehouse`.
* Get the snap for your systemd-powered Linux distro from either the
[Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/dogehouse) or in an terminal with
`sudo snap install dogehouse`.
  * After installing the snap, you need to allow microphone access with
`sudo snap connect dogehouse:audio-record` to be able to speak in rooms.

[gh-releases]: https://github.com/benawad/dogehouse/releases/latest

**_Notes:_**

- If a warning message pops up on Windows, go to 'more info' and select 'Run Anyway'
- Currently, the snap package's available channels are only `edge` as
contributions for Baklava are merged almost on daily basis. Tested
versions that are stable will be promoted into `stable` in the future.
