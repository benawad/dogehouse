# What is this folder?

This folder is called pilaf it is the ReactNative Application

# How can I contribute?

First of all, this project is currently in _very_ early stages of development, therefore these instructions may not be up to date.

**We're using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for this project, do not use npm for the following commands**

Compile @dogehouse/kebab by executing the following commands:

```bash
cd ../kebab
yarn
yarn build
```

After you successfully compiled Kebab, go back to this directory and install all modules (@dogehouse/kebab is a yarn workspace, you do <u>not</u> need to manually copy it to node_modules)

You should now be all set to go, go ahead and run the dev server

```bash
cd ../pilaf
yarn
yarn start
```

You now have a metro bundler running, you can start the app on Android or iOS
